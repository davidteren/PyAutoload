# Performance Optimizations for Large Projects

## Description
Improve PyAutoload's performance when working with large projects by implementing caching mechanisms, incremental scanning, and configuration options for performance tuning.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement a caching mechanism for the module registry
- [ ] Add incremental scanning for large directories
- [ ] Create benchmarking tests for performance validation
- [ ] Consider implementing parallel directory traversal for initial scanning
- [ ] Add configuration options for performance tuning:
  - [ ] Maximum directory depth
  - [ ] Exclusion patterns for large directories
  - [ ] Cache persistence options

## Acceptance Criteria
- Measurable performance improvement for large projects
- Benchmarking tests show at least 30% improvement in scanning time
- Configuration options work as expected and are well-documented
- No regression in functionality for existing features

## Additional Notes
Performance may become a significant concern for projects with hundreds or thousands of modules. These optimizations will ensure PyAutoload remains practical for projects of any size.
