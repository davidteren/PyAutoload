# Design Challenges: Implementing Zeitwerk-like Autoloading in Python

## Core Challenges

### 1. Fundamental Differences Between Ruby and Python Import Systems

Ruby's constant resolution mechanism differs significantly from Python's import system:

- **Ruby**: Uses a global constant namespace and resolves constants at runtime with an auto-loading mechanism that can be hooked into
- **Python**: Uses explicit imports and a module-based system with a more structured lookup process

Zeitwerk leverages Ruby's constant resolution by intercepting constant lookup and dynamically loading the corresponding file. Python doesn't have an equivalent mechanism for intercepting constant resolution.

### 2. Python's Import System

Python's import system is structured around:

- A module cache (`sys.modules`)
- Import hooks (`sys.meta_path` and `sys.path_hooks`)
- Package initialization via `__init__.py` files
- A hierarchical namespace system

To implement Zeitwerk-like behavior, we'll need to create custom import hooks using the `importlib` machinery:

```python
# Conceptual example of using import hooks
import sys
from importlib.abc import Loader, MetaPathFinder
from importlib.util import spec_from_file_location

class PyAutoloadFinder(MetaPathFinder):
    # Implementation to find modules based on naming conventions
    pass

class PyAutoloadLoader(Loader):
    # Implementation to load modules when requested
    pass

# Register our finder in the import system
sys.meta_path.insert(0, PyAutoloadFinder())
```

### 3. Autovivification Challenges

Zeitwerk automatically creates modules for directories. In Python, this requires:

1. Creating module objects for directories
2. Registering these modules in `sys.modules`
3. Handling `__init__.py` files appropriately
4. Managing parent-child relationships between modules

### 4. Thread Safety Requirements

Both lazy loading and module reloading present thread safety challenges:

- Multiple threads may try to load the same module simultaneously
- Reloading a module while it's being used by another thread can cause inconsistencies
- Python's import system has its own locking mechanism we must respect

### 5. Integration with Existing Code

Python projects often use a variety of import styles and patterns:

- Relative imports
- Star imports
- Circular dependencies
- Import-time side effects

Our solution must handle these gracefully without breaking existing code.

## Proposed Architecture

### 1. Custom Import Hooks

Implement a `MetaPathFinder` and `Loader` that:

- Maps file paths to module names based on conventions
- Handles lazy loading via the import system
- Maintains a registry of discovered modules
- Respects package boundaries

### 2. Module Registry

Maintain a mapping between:

- File paths
- Module names
- Loaded module objects
- Dependencies between modules

### 3. File System Scanner

Create a scanner that:

- Traverses directories recursively
- Identifies Python modules and packages
- Builds the module registry
- Understands naming conventions

### 4. Reloading System

Implement a reloading mechanism that:

- Watches for file changes
- Safely reloads modified modules
- Updates dependent modules
- Handles edge cases like deleted files

### 5. Thread Safety

Ensure thread safety through:

- Proper locking mechanisms
- Atomic operations where possible
- Respecting Python's import locks
- Clear documentation about thread-safety guarantees
