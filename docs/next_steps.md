# PyAutoload: Next Steps

Based on the project analysis, we've identified several key areas for improvement. The following roadmap outlines our priorities:

## 1. Namespace Package Support

While we've started implementing support for namespace packages, there are still improvements to make:

- [ ] Enhance `FileScanner` to fully support PEP 420 namespace packages
- [ ] Properly handle directories without `__init__.py` files
- [ ] Add tests specifically for namespace package detection and loading
- [ ] Document the namespace package support and limitations

**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium (3-5 days)

## 2. Performance Considerations

For large projects, performance will become a concern:

- [ ] Implement a caching mechanism for the module registry
- [ ] Add incremental scanning for large directories
- [ ] Add benchmarking tests for performance validation
- [ ] Consider parallel directory traversal for initial scanning
- [ ] Add configuration options for performance tuning:
  - [ ] Maximum directory depth
  - [ ] Exclusion patterns for large directories
  - [ ] Cache persistence options

**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium-High (1-2 weeks)

## 3. Comprehensive Documentation

To improve adoption and usability:

- [ ] Create detailed API documentation with examples
- [ ] Add integration examples for popular frameworks (Flask, Django, FastAPI)
- [ ] Create a user guide with step-by-step tutorials
- [ ] Improve docstrings throughout the codebase
- [ ] Add diagrams explaining the architecture and module flow
- [ ] Document known limitations and workarounds
- [ ] Add a troubleshooting section for common issues

**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium (1 week)

## 4. Additional Improvements

Other areas to address:

- [ ] Add more robust error handling, especially for edge cases
- [ ] Improve circular dependency detection and reporting
- [ ] Add configuration flexibility for cache location, logging, etc.
- [ ] Consider a plugin system for custom import behaviors
- [ ] Add type hints throughout the codebase
- [ ] Improve logging and debugging capabilities

**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium (1 week)

## 5. Community and Feedback

To grow adoption:

- [ ] Release alpha version to PyPI
- [ ] Create a project website or comprehensive README
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines
- [ ] Set up CI/CD for automated testing
- [ ] Seek feedback from Python developer communities

**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: Low (2-3 days)
