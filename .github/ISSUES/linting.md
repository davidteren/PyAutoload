# Add linting to the project

## Description
We need to add linting to ensure code quality and consistent style across the codebase.

## Tasks
- [ ] Add flake8 for code style and quality checks
- [ ] Add black for code formatting
- [ ] Add isort for import ordering
- [ ] Create configuration files (.flake8, pyproject.toml)
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for enforcing linting rules
- [ ] Add GitHub workflow for linting checks on PRs
- [ ] Update documentation with linting guidelines

## Acceptance Criteria
- Linting tools (flake8, black, isort) are correctly configured
- All existing code passes linting checks
- Pre-commit hooks are functioning
- GitHub workflows for linting are operational
- Documentation is updated with instructions for contributors

## Additional Notes
Consider adding typing checks with mypy in the future.
